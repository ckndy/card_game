##Weekend Homework 
###Card Game 

This weekend's homework is to model a basic card game and implement the rules.

We aren't looking for a running game, just good TDD to demonstrate that the game works as it should.

####Part A - Highest Card
Build a simple card game that deals one card to every player and the player with the highest card wins. 

####Part B - Simple Blackjack 
Extend Part A to now deal 2 cards to every player and the player with the highest combination of cards wins. 

####Optional - BlackJack
- Extend your code to start to implement the rules of blackjack, where each player starts with 2 cards and attempts to get as close to 21 without going over. 
- After the initial deal each player should be able to 'draw' a new card and check whether the new card has made their total exceed 21 or not. 
- If they do exceed 21 and have an 'Ace', the ace should change value from 11 to 1.
